## From Chaos to Clarity: Building a Production-Grade Event-Driven Serverless Platform

This repository represents the transformation of a messy, tightly coupled event-driven architecture into a well-structured, scalable, and reusable serverless platform built entirely with Terraform and Java-based AWS Lambda. What started as an ad-hoc infrastructure setup evolved into a clear separation of concerns—application code, environment configuration, and infrastructure modules—designed with real-world production standards in mind.

The project demonstrates how to design and manage an event-driven serverless system using modular Terraform, environment isolation (dev / prod), reusable IAM patterns, artifact-driven Lambda deployments via S3, and clean Maven-based Java services. Every module is intentionally structured to support scalability, maintainability, and team collaboration, mirroring how modern product-based organizations build cloud-native platforms.

Below are the architecture diagrams that visually explain how the components interact and how the system scales in a real production environment.
